# About Me
## Aditya Srinivasulu
### BSc (Osmania University), MSc (University of Derby)
I work as a researcher with the Wildlife Information and Liaison Development (WILD) Society (Coimbatore, India), Biodiversity Research and Conservation Society (BRACONS, Hyderabad, India), and actively collaborate with the Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Studies, Osmania University (Hyderabad, India), and the Universities of Bristol (Bristol, UK), and the West of England (Bristol, UK). In September 2021, I will begin my doctoral studies at the University of Reading School of Biological Sciences, under the supervision of Dr Manuela Gonzalez-Suarez.

My research primarily focuses on bats and herpetofauna in South Asia, with an emphasis on integrative taxonomy and systematics, and conservation.
